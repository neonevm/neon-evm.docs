          description: Gas fee as hexadecimal value in Galan (NEON). The `gas_price` may be lower than the suggested_gas_price. The `gas_price` may NOT be lower than `min_acceptable_gas_price`, in which case the transaction would be rejected by Neon Proxy. if `gas-price` is less than `min_executable_gas_price`, tx is accepted to Neon Proxy's mempool, to wait untill `min_executable_gas_price` drops to equate with/be less than `gas-price`.
