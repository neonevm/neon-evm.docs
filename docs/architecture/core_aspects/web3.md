title: Web3 concept
---

**Web2** refers to the version of the internet most of us know today: an internet dominated by companies that provide services in exchange for your personal data.  
**Web3** refers to decentralized apps that run on the blockchain. These apps allow anyone to participate without monetizing their personal data.

## The Differences Between Web2 and Web3

**Web2** | **Web3**  
:-------- |:--------  
Twitter can censor any account or tweet | **Web3** tweets would be uncensorable because control is decentralized  
Payment service may decide not to allow payments for certain types of work | **Web3** payment apps require no personal data and can't prevent payments  
Servers for gig-economy apps could go down and affect worker income | **Web3** servers can't go down – they use a decentralized network of many computers as their backend  

## Web3 Limitations

**Web3** has some limitations:
* **Scalability** – transactions are slower on Web3 because they're decentralized. 
* **UX** – interacting with Web3 applications can require extra steps, software, and education.
* **Cost** – most successful dApps put very small portions of their code on the blockchain as it's expensive.
