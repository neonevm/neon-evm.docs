Ethereum is moving to a consensus mechanism called **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)** from **Proof-of-Work (PoW)**.

## What is Proof-of-Stake?
**PoS** is a method of cryptocurrency protection in which the probability of forming the next block in the blockchain depends on the existing stake of the participant and not on powerful equipment, as is the case with **PoW**.

## How does PoS work?

The network itself verifies transactions. It also maintains anonymity and security, since the cryptocurrency is already distributed among the users of the network.  

Unlike **PoW**, validators don't need to use significant amounts of computational power because they're selected at random and aren't competing. They don't need to mine blocks; they just need to create blocks when chosen and validate proposed blocks when they're not. This validation is known as attesting.

## The PoS concept

* The **PoS** concept states that people can mine or verify block transactions depending on how many coins they hold. This means that the more coins miners own, the more mining power they have.
* The probability of checking a new block is determined by how large of a share that a person holds.
* Validators do not receive block rewards; instead, they take network commission as their reward.
* Unlike **PoW**, **PoS** systems can be more cost-effective and efficient, but less decentralized.
