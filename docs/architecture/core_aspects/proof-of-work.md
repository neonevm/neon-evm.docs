title: Proof-of-Work
---

**Proof-of-work (PoW)** is a consensus protocol (proof-of-work completion) that allows the decentralized Ethereum network to come to consensus or agree on things like account balances and the order of transactions. This prevents users "double spending" their coins and ensures that the Ethereum chain is incredibly difficult to attack or overwrite.

## How does Ethereum's PoW work?

Ethereum transactions are processed into blocks. Each block has a:
* **Block difficulty** – for example: `3,092,324,262,183,265`
* **MixHash** – for example: `0xf83b13079807244144bca881b07a6a09705d9f2f39a3cdf3bee29a665c5ac8bd`
* **Nonce** – for example: `0x4fb3d26bd3ee432b`

This block data is directly related to PoW.

## Compared to PoS

**PoW**  
Cryptocurrency mining requires expensive equipment, special knowledge, and labor. Most cryptocurrencies operate on the **PoW** protocol.  

**PoS**  
The number of coins in the user's account or on lease reflects their mining power. The more coins a user has, the higher their chances of creating the next block and, accordingly, receiving a reward from the transaction fee.
