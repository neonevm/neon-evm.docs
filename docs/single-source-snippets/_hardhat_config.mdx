To deploy a contract to Neon EVM with Hardhat, some Neon-specific information must be configured. The configuration file is called `hardhat.config.js` and is located at the root of your project directory. This JavaScript file can execute any code necessary to create your configuration. Its file schema, variables, and other documentation can be found on the [official Hardhat website](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/config).
