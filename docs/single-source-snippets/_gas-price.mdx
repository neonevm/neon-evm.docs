The **gas price** is the cost of 1 unit of gas in NEON. This price is calculated using the following forumla:

> (1 + Proxy Operator fee) \* SOL-to-NEON-rate \* 10<sup>-9</sup> NEONs

which can also be represented as:

> (1 + Proxy Operator fee) \* SOL-to-NEON-rate Galans

This amount is usually displayed for users in Galans (10<sup>-9</sup> NEONs).

The final formula for the gas fee for a Neon transaction with N iterations and S newly allocated bytes is:

> “Gas amount” \* “Gas price”

> = [ N \* 2 \* 5,000 + S \* 6,960 ] \* (1 + Proxy Operator fee) \* SOL-to-NEON-rate
