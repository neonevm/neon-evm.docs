*This page, based on k0s's [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.k0sproject.io/v1.21.2+k0s.0/install/#install-k0s), outlines the steps for setting up Kubernetes with k0s for the purpose of running neon-proxy later on.*

[k0s](https://k0sproject.io/) is an all-inclusive [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) distribution that offers an easy, smooth way to create Kubernetes clusters ready for production usage. k0s fits well in any cloud environment on any system that includes the Linux kernel. Please note that this tutorial has been written for **Debian/Ubuntu**, but it can be used for any Linux running one of the supported init systems: Systemd or OpenRC.

## Prerequisites
Before you start, verify that your environment meets the [system requirements for k0s](https://docs.k0sproject.io/v1.21.2+k0s.0/system-requirements/).

In addition, make sure the following software is installed on your device:
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/), a command-line tool for Kubernetes' control plane
* [Helm 3](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/), Kubernetes' package manager

## Set up a Single Kubernetes Node with k0s

### Download the k0s binary
Run the k0s download script to download the latest stable version of k0s and make it executable from `/usr/bin/k0s`
```bash 
sudo curl -sSLf https://get.k0s.sh | sudo sh
```

### Install k0s as a service
Install k0s controller as a system service and enable worker
```bash 
sudo k0s install controller --enable-worker
```

### Start k0s as a service
To start the k0s service, run
```bash
sudo k0s start
```

### Check status
Check service, logs, and k0s status
```bash
sudo k0s status
```

### Access the k0s cluster using kubectl
Check if your node is ready running
```bash
sudo k0s kubectl get nodes
```

List the default namespaces for your k0s installation
```bash
sudo k0s kubectl get namespaces
```

You now have a working Kubernetes cluster and can spin up a neon-proxy with it.

## Add More Kubernetes Nodes to the Cluster
For scaling purposes, you may opt to add multiple workers to your Kubernetes cluster. To do so, you need to generate a token that can be shared between your nodes/workers. This token contains all the information in order to join the cluster.

First, log in your control-plane/controller node and generate the `main` token as a base64-encoded file
```bash
k0s token create --role=worker
```

:::caution
Please keep this token file in a safe and secure location!
:::

Now log into worker/node and install k0s
```bash
sudo curl -sSLf https://get.k0s.sh | sudo sh
```

In your worker/node, paste the base64 token generated by the controller node earlier into a file, e.g., `/tmp/token.cluster`, and then start the k0s service
```bash
sudo k0s install worker --token-file /tmp/token.cluster
sudo k0s start
```

The worker is now a part of the cluster. Wait a few minutes and you can see that your node has been added to the cluster:
```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

For a full list of configuration options, please refer to the [official k0s documentation](https://docs.k0sproject.io/latest/high-availability/).
