## Technology

### What is Neon EVM?

Neon EVM is an Ethereum Virtual Machine operating as a smart contract on Solana. It gives developers the power to directly deploy Ethereum dApps with no code change while benefiting from Solana's technical advantages, and is built with security, decentralization, and sustainability top of mind.

### How does Neon EVM Work?

Neon EVM is a smart contract on Solana acting as the Ethereum Virtual Machine. It is compiled into Berkeley Packet Filter bytecode, a format that can be executed on Solana. This allows Neon EVM to receive Solana transactions that contain wrapped Ethereum-like transactions and process them on Solana according to Ethereum rules. Get more details [here](https://docs.neonfoundation.io/docs/about/how_it_works).

### How can I start building on Neon?

To begin building on Neon, follow our [Quick Start Guide](/docs/quick_start). Porting and deploying your existing EVM contracts onto Neon using Truffle, Remix, or Hardhat is also an easy and seamless process.

### Why is Neon good for Ethereum dApps?

As a smart contract on Solana, Neon EVM benefits from Solana’s low gas fees (no less than 0.000015 SOL per transaction) and high throughput (+2,000 TPS). This makes it the cheapest and most efficient way anywhere to run Ethereum dApps.

Neon EVM does not require any significant changes to run existing Ethereum smart contracts, with all the advantages and innovations of Solana. In addition, the Neon EVM provides access to many familiar Ethereum developer tools, including MetaMask, Remix, Hardhat, Truffle, and Brownie. Neon is the perfect platform for Ethereum dApps to tap into the Solana ecosystem.

### What makes Neon EVM so special?

Neon EVM is unique in combining the powerful technical advantages of Solana with the vibrant development community and expertise of Ethereum. In general, it is much easier to port over existing EVM smart contract code than to build natively on Solana from scratch.

### What tools are currently available on Neon?

The following tools are available on Neon:
* [NeonScan](https://neonscan.org/) - Neon EVM’s block explorer
* [NeonPass](https://neonpass.live/) - A utility for transferring SPL tokens between Solana and Neon
* [Neon Faucet](https://neonfaucet.org/) - Where tokens for the Neon Devnet may be retrieved for testing and experimental purposes

### How do I transfer SPL tokens between Solana and Neon?

[NeonPass](https://neonpass.live/) is an open-source service that facilitates token transfers between Solana and Neon EVM, including the NEON SPL token. To use NeonPass, you must have access to two wallets: a Solana wallet, such as [Phantom](https://phantom.app/), and an EVM wallet, such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) for Neon.
