# Neon Pass Overview

Neon Pass is open source service that provides a user with the following features:
  * transfer SPL tokens to Neon EVM to a non-existent account that will be created during the transfer.
  * transfer SPL tokens to Neon EVM to an existing account that does not yet have an ERC-20 balance.
  * transfer SPL tokens to Neon EVM to an existing account that has an ERC-20 balance.
  * withdrawal of ERC-20 tokens from Neon EVM to an existing account that has an SPL balance.

Solana has its own ERC-20 tokens generated by the special application. These tokens are on the balances of SPL accounts inside Solana. Operating balances is possible only through a solana's wallet (for example, through [Phantom](https://docs.neon-labs.org/docs/glossary#phantom)). There is no way to directly manage these balances from the Neon EVM.

We provide you with Neon Pass that allows you to make transactions with SPL tokens quickly and conveniently. To transfer tokens from Solana to Neon EVM as well as from Neon EVM to Solana, 2 wallets are required â€” [Phantom](https://docs.neon-labs.org/docs/glossary#phantom) and [Metamask](https://docs.neon-labs.org/docs/glossary#metamask), which provide the addresses of a recipient and a sender. Transactions are signed with keys obtained from these addresses.

> The Neon Swap service provides Ethereum users with the ability to transfer SPL tokens to Neon EVM and withdraw them back.
