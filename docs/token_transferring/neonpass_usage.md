## TL;DR

## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to transfer tokens between Solana and Neon EVM using the [NeonPass](https://neonpass.live/) UI. The same tooling is available as an [npm package](/docs/developing/integrate/neon_transfer).

You can transfer tokens in either direction, but each transaction incurs a gas fee in either NEON or SOL.

:::info
 Neon EVM's Devnet now supports a feature providing the option to pay the gas fees with the [token of transaction](https://neonevm.org/blog/feature-alternative-gas-fee-token), rather than only NEON or SOL.
:::

:::important
When transferring tokens from Neon EVM to Solana for the first time, ensure that you have SOL in your Solana wallet to cover the transaction costs. This is a one-time requirement for the initial transfer.
:::

## Prerequisites

- Neon EVM-compatible wallet (e.g. Atomic Wallet, MetaMask, Rabby Wallet, WalletConnect, Trust Wallet, Ledger, etc.)
- Solana-compatible wallet (e.g. Phantom, Solfare, etc.)
- Browser with both wallet applications attached
- Token balance to pay gas fees

## Transfer tokens with NeonPass

### Step 1: Set up wallets

1.1 Navigate to [NeonPass](https://neonpass.live/).

1.2 Add your required Neon EVM Network in your Neon compatible wallet through [Chainlist.org/chain/245022934](https://chainlist.org/?chain=245022934&search=Neon+EVM&testnets=true).

> For further help, see our [wallet setup walkthrough](/docs/wallet/metamask_setup).

### Step 2: Connect wallets to NeonPass

:::tip
Remember to use a browser to which both your Solana and Neon EVM compatible wallets are attached.
:::

2.1 Click **Connect Wallet** to connect your Solana compatible wallet to NeonPass. Follow the login procedure in your wallet's popup window and ensure it's connected to the network you require (e.g. Mainnet).

2.2 Repeat this step for your Neon EVM compatible wallet.

### Step 3: Conduct transfer

<Tabs>

 <TabItem value="neontosolana" label="Neon EVM to Solana" default>

3.1 Select the transfer direction from Neon EVM to Solana.

<img src={image2} width="450" style={{ display: 'block', margin: '10px auto' }} />

:::important
Your first ever transaction from your wallet includes a one time fee to generate the Solana account linked to your address. Therefore the first transaction will be more expensive than the subsequent ones.
:::

3.2 Choose the token and enter the amount to transfer.

3.3 Click **Transfer** and sign the transaction in your connected wallets.

3.4 Review the transaction summary and enjoy your tokens in Solana!

 </TabItem>

 <TabItem value="solanatoneon" label="Solana to Neon EVM">

3.1 Select the transfer direction from Solana to Neon EVM.

<img src={image4} width="450" style={{ display: 'block', margin: '10px auto' }} />

3.2 Choose the token, enter the amount, and select the gas token (NEON or SOL).

3.3 Are you an expert user? Click on 'Advanced Mode' and select a different priority fee to speed up 

3.4 Click **Transfer** and sign the transaction in your connected wallets.

3.5 Review the transaction summary and enjoy your tokens in Neon EVM!

 </TabItem>

</Tabs>

**Verify the transaction on [NeonScan](https://neonscan.org/) or [Blockscout](https://neon.blockscout.com/).**

We hope that you love NeonPass and that you are ready to leverage the full potential of Neon EVM by facilitating hassle-free transfers of assets to and from Solana.

## Gas Fees and Priority Selection

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="neontosolana" label="Neon EVM to Solana" default>

When transferring tokens from Neon EVM to Solana:
- You can pay gas fees in NEON or the token of transaction.
- If you're withdrawing to a new Solana account or an existing account that has never received the specific ERC-20 token before, ensure that you have sufficient SOL in your Solana wallet to cover the gas fees.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="solanatoneon" label="Solana to Neon EVM">

When transferring tokens from Solana to Neon EVM:
- For sending NEON tokens, you can choose between NEON and SOL as the gas token.
- For sending SPL tokens (e.g., USDC), only SOL can be used as the gas token.

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::important
Please be aware of the gas fee specificities for each transfer direction. Always ensure you have sufficient funds in the appropriate token to cover gas fees before initiating a transfer.

By following these steps, you can easily transfer tokens using NeonPass on your mobile device, enjoying a seamless and user-friendly experience on the go.

## Under the hood

Neon EVM isn't a blockchain, and so it follows that NeonPass isn't a conventional blockchain bridge. Your assets are not wrapped. Instead, Neon EVM applies an ERC-20 interface, making SPL tokens behave like Ethereum-natives when in the Neon network. [Learn more about how NeonPass works](/docs/tokens/token-accounts).
