The easiest way to program transferring tokens between Neon and Solana chains is the leverage of **Neon Transfer SDK**.
In essence, it provides a similar to the [NeonPass UI](https://devnet.neonpass.live) functionality.
- Transfer NEON tokens from Neon EVM to Solana and from Solana to Neon EVM.
- Transfer SOL tokens from Neon EVM to Solana and from Solana to Neon EVM.
- Transfer ERC-20 tokens from Neon EVM to Solana and from Solana to Neon EVM.

The SDK is provided as an npm package. You can easily set it up and use it, guided by the comprehensive [specification of the Neon Transfer SDK](https://sdk.neonevm.org/).
Additionally, you can refer to 
- Codebase and `examples` folder in the [Github repo](https://github.com/neonlabsorg/neon-client-transfer).
- Live [React demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/neon-transfer-demo-z93nlj).
