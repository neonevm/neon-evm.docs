title: Getting Started
---

*The purpose of this guide is to get you familiarized with the Neon EVM's high-level structure and to provide you with step-by-step instructions on how to set up your local Neon EVM development environment.*

## Quick Start

To get started quickly with Neon, follow the steps below. 

### Step 1: Install MetaMask
Install MetaMask by following the setup instructions on the [Installing MetaMask](wallet/metamask_setup.md#installing-metamask) page.

### Step 2: Connect MetaMask to the Neon EVM Devnet
There are two ways to connect to the Solana [Devnet](https://docs.solana.com/clusters#devnet) cluster: using Chainlist.org or manually.

#### Option A: Connect with Chainlist.org
Go to [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/) and type `Neon` in the search bar. You should see `Neon EVM Devnet` and `Neon EVM MainNet`.

Select `Neon EVM Devnet` and click `Connect Wallet`. A MetaMask pop-up window will show. Click `Next` and then `Connect`. You can now access the [Solana cluster](https://docs.solana.com/clusters) and carry out transactions.

#### Option B: Connect Manually with MetaMask
Alternatively, you can connect to the Neon EVM Devnet [manually via MetaMask](wallet/metamask_setup.md#setting-up-an-rpc-network).

## Deploying dApps

Deploying dApps on Neon is easy and you can do so with [Remix](https://remix-project.org/), [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/), and [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/).
