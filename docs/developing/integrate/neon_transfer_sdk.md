This page provides you with the information required to pass tokens between Solana and Neon EVM programmatically. 

## TL;DR

- The tool is available as an npm package
- The package provides the same function as the [NeonPass UI](do this link)

## Introduction

The following npm package provides a token pass tool. This same package provides the functionality to the NeonPass UI tool. It is built to be compliant with the React hooks architecture, but you are welcome to use clean core functions.

You need to provide the addresses for a Solana-compatible wallet such as the Phantom wallet and an EVM-compatible wallet such as the MetaMask wallet. Both of these addresses are passed as required properties. The codule checks whether both wallet objects - window.solana and window.ehtereum - really exist. If they don't, the module will throw an error for you. 


For clean working configuration example we have to rebuild connect status buttons, their transfer callbacks and error handling.

## Step 1: installation and setup

Firstly, install the package:

```sh
npm install neon-portal --save
```

## Step 2: understand the parameters

The following table provides details of the required and optional parameters. 


|Property name |   Type|Description| is required |
|:-------------|:------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:------------|
|solanaWalletAddress |  String  |Address for Solana-compatible wallet  |        true |
|neonWalletAddress |  String  | Address of existing EVM-compatible wallet associated with a Neon Account | true |
|web3 | Object| Connection module of Ethereum Web3.js framework. Connects the App to the Neon EVM network.| true |
|connection |  Object  | Connection module of Solana-Web3.js framework. You may connect to your own node if you have one. Else you will be provided with the default RPC.|        true |
|onBeforeCreateInstructions | function |Function executed at the start of transfer intitation. It is used in both transfer functions (`createNeonTransfer` and `createSolanaTransfer`).  | false |
|onCreateNeonAccountInstruction | function | Function, executed on instruction build <!-- todo find out more --> | false |
|onBeforeSignTransaction | function | Function called before transaction is signed by Solana-compatible wallet. <!-- todo unpack whether is used by "both" txs -->| false |
|onBeforeNeonSign | function |Function used when you transfer from Neon EVM to Solana. Called before request for tx approval.    |       false |
|onSuccessSign | function | Function, that extracts signatures after the tx is signed. With transfer to Neon, the function requires one argument - the Solana transaction signature. On transfer to Solana, it requires two arguments: Solana and Neon signatures. <!-- todo follow up and verify that this is genuine --> |false |
|onErrorSign | function | Function called if wallet throws an error after sign attempt. |false |

## Examples

### Vanilla JS

```javascript
import { NeonPortal } from "neon-portal"
//for transfer ERC20 tokens use:
import { MintPortal } from "neon-portal"

const eventParams = {
  onBeforeSignTransaction: () => {
    /* Your state changes here */
  },
  /* ... */
};
const portal = new NeonPortal({
  solanaWalletAddress: publicKey,
  neonWalletAddress: account,
  customConnection: connection,
  /*
    You can pass events as properties, but these functions will be called at portal context.
  */
  ...eventParams,
});
button.addEventListener("onClick", (e) => {
  /*
    If you want to save context of event function - pass it as first argument
    Else first argument should be undefined
  */
  portal.createNeonTransfer(eventParams, amount, splToken);
});
```

### React

You can use the React hook provided by the package. This hook allows you to pass event parameters as objects. The module can be used by the React wrapper:

```javascript
import {useNeonTransfer} from "neon-portal/src/react"
```


For example:


``` javascript
export const useTransfering = () => {
  const { setPending, setSign, setError } = useStates()
  const { publicKey } = useWallet()
  const { account, library } = useWeb3React();
  // The following function `useConnection` defaults to a publically-available RPC. If you are using your own Solana node in the context of your App, pass the RPC address as a second argument to the neon transfer hook. 
  const connection = useConnection()
  // The next line calls the React hook `useNeonTransfer`, this will import both functions: createNeonTransfer and createSolanaTransfer.
  const { createNeonTransfer, createSolanaTransfer } = useNeonTransfer(
    {
      onBeforeCreateInstruction: () => {
        setPending(true)
      },
      onBeforeSignTransaction: () => {
        setPending(false)
        setTransfering(true)
      },
      /*
    sig - Signature of the sending wallet, i.e. of the user approving the transaction request
    txHash - Identifier of the transaction on Neon EVM <!-- todo need to confirm is this a txHash on Neon NOT on Solana ?? -->
    */
      onSuccessSign: (sig, txHash) => {
        setSign(sig, txHash)
        setTransfering(false)
      },
      onErrorSign: (e) => {
        setError(e.message)
        setPending(false)
      },
    },
    connection,
    library, // Web3 Library instance  
    publicKey, // Phantom wallet public key
    account // MetaMask wallet public key associated with a Neon Account
  )
  return { createNeonTransfer, createSolanaTransfer }
}
```
