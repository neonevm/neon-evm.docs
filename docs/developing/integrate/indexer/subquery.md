SubQuery is a leading blockchain data indexer offering developers fast, flexible, universal, open-source, and decentralized APIs for Web3 projects. SubQuery SDK allows developers to get rich indexed data and build intuitive and immersive decentralised applications in a faster and more efficient way.

Another one of SubQuery's competitive advantages is the ability to aggregate data not only within a chain but across multiple blockchains all within a single project. This allows the creation of feature-rich dashboard analytics and multi-chain block scanners. Other advantages include superior performance with multiple RPC endpoint configurations, multi-worker capabilities and a configurable caching architecture.

## Running and Hosting your Neon EVM SubQuery APIs

SubQuery is open-source and designed to be easy to run, meaning you have the freedom to run it a variety of ways:

- [Locally on your own computer or on your cloud provider of choice.](https://subquery.network/doc/indexer/run_publish/introduction.html#locally-run-it-yourself)
- [By publishing it to the decentralised SubQuery Network](https://subquery.network/doc/indexer/run_publish/introduction.html#publish-to-the-subquery-network), the most open, performant, reliable, and scalable data service for dApp developers.
- [Leveraging a centralised hosting partner in the SubQuery community](https://subquery.network/doc/indexer/run_publish/introduction.html#other-hosting-providers-in-the-subquery-community), like OnFinality or Traceye.
