## Introduction

[Pyth](https://pyth.network/) is an open-source real-time on-chain market data feed. It supports Neon EVM and its repo is maintained by Pyth on GitHub at [pyth-network/pyth-neon](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-neon).

This guide contains a smart contract making Pyth price feeds available on Neon EVM.

It is **strongly recommended** to follow the [consumer best practices](https://docs.pyth.network/consumers/best-practices) when consuming Pyth data.

## How to Use

To consume prices, you need to look up the price feed ID for the token symbol you are interested in.
The Pyth Network website lists the NEON price feed IDs for [devnet](https://pyth.network/developers/price-feed-ids/#neon-evm-devnet) and [mainnet](https://pyth.network/developers/price-feed-ids/#neon-evm-mainnet).

```javascript
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity/PythStructs.sol";

contract ExampleContract {

    function getBTCUSDPrice() public returns (PythStructs.Price memory) {

        // The NEON Devnet price feed ID of BTC/USD
        bytes32 priceID = 0xf9c0172ba10dfa4d19088d94f5bf61d3b54d5bd7483a322a982e1373ee8ea31b;

        return pyth.getCurrentPrice(priceID);
    }

}
```

### How to Deploy

1. Create a `.secret` file containing the private key or mnemonic of the account you want to use to deploy the
   contracts.
2. (Optional) Edit `truffle-config.js` to add the NEON network you want to deploy to.
3. Run `truffle migrate --network neon_devnet`
