title: Choosing an Environment
---

Depending on the tasks to be solved, you can use one of three options for setting up the environment:
  * [Option 1:](#option-1-interaction-with-the-solana-cluster-via-a-proxy-hosted-on-a-remote-virtual-server) The proxy is hosted on a remote virtual server. Solana [Testnet](https://docs.solana.com/clusters#testnet)/[Devnet](https://docs.solana.com/clusters#devnet)/[Mainnet](https://docs.solana.com/clusters#mainnet-beta) is used.
  * [Option 2:](#option-2-running-solana-testnet-via-a-proxy-hosted-locally) The proxy is hosted locally. Solana [Testnet](https://docs.solana.com/clusters#testnet)/[Devnet](https://docs.solana.com/clusters#devnet)/[Mainnet](https://docs.solana.com/clusters#mainnet-beta) is used.
  * [Option 3:](#option-3-running-solana-via-a-proxy-when-both-are-hosted-locally) Both the proxy and Solana are hosted locally (debug mode, which allows you to configure your node locally).
