This tutorial will give an overview of how to connect to a Neon RPC, resulting in a network configuration where Neon is connected to a remote Neon Proxy and to remote Solana.

## Connecting MetaMask to Neon EVM
Go to [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/) and type `Neon` in the search bar. You should see `Neon EVM Devnet` and `Neon EVM MainNet`.

Select, for instance, `Neon EVM Devnet` and click `Connect Wallet`. A MetaMask pop-up window will show. Click `Next` and then `Connect`. You can now access the [Solana cluster](https://docs.solana.com/clusters) and carry out transactions.

## Choosing a Remote Proxy
Before sending a transaction to the Neon EVM, users should choose the operator that is optimal for them to perform the transaction. The operator is not chosen directly, but through the proxies they serve.

A table of RPC proxies operated by Neon Labs, shown below, has the following columns:
  * `Network (Chain ID)` — the Solana network and its identifier; the network determines what RPC URL proxy can be used.
  * `Operator name` — the name of the operator providing the proxy.
  * `RPC URL` — the address for interacting with the required proxy.

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
        <th>Network</th>
        <th>Operator name</th>
        <th>RPC URL</th>
        <th>Chain ID</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Devnet</th>
        <td><a href="https://neon-labs.org">Neon Labs</a></td>
        <td>https://devnet.neonevm.org</td>
        <th>245022926</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Testnet</th>
        <td><a href="https://neon-labs.org">Neon Labs</a></td>
        <td>https://testnet.neonevm.org	</td>
        <th>245022940</th>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The proxy interacts with one EVM loader, which can be deployed in different Solana chains. This interaction allows the proxy to be used on different networks (Testnet, Devnet, Mainnet Beta).

For a complete table of the RPC go to [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/) and type `Neon` in the search bar.

## Connecting Dev tools to Neon EVM

To connect to a proxy using Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat, check out the following resources:
* [Using Remix](developing/deploy_facilities/using_remix.md)
* [Using Truffle](developing/deploy_facilities/using_truffle.md)
* [Using Hardhat](developing/deploy_facilities/using_hardhat.md)

Please note that, for Truffle and Hardhat, you need to configure the configuration file by setting either the `HDWalletProvider` provider (for Truffle) or the URL and the `network_id`/`chainId` to the RPC URL (and ID) selected from the table above. This is described in detail in the relevant tutorial sections.

## Connecting Manually with MetaMask
The above steps demonstrate how to connect to the Solana Devnet cluster via Chainlist. Alternatively, you can connect to the Neon EVM Devnet [manually via MetaMask](wallet/metamask_setup.md#setting-up-an-rpc-network).
