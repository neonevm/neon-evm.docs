This tutorial walks through deploying a contract describing an ERC-20 token to Neon Devnet.

## Introduction

This tutorial is based on an [example in GitHub](https://github.com/neonlabsorg/neon-tutorials/tree/main/foundry).

:::info
This page is a quickstart based on a specific example program. For more details on installing Foundry, refer to the _[Foundry documentation](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)_.
:::

## Prerequisites

- An EVM-compatible wallet, such as MetaMask [connected to Devnet](/docs/developing/connect_rpc#connect-via-chainlist)
- A balance in [Devnet NEON](https://neonfaucet.org/)

### Step 1: Installation

1.1 Clone the example Foundry project from the remote repository and navigate to it:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/neonlabsorg/neon-tutorials
cd neon-tutorials/foundry
```

1.2 Install Foundryup with:

```sh
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

:::info
`foundryup` installs the latest _(nightly)_ precompiled binaries: forge, cast, anvil, and chisel.
:::

1.3 Install the required libraries:

```sh
forge install foundry-rs/forge-std --no-commit
forge install openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts --no-commit
```

### Step 2: Set up an environment file

:::info
This step requires an EVM-compatible wallet such as MetaMask, connected to Neon Devnet, with a balance in Devnet NEON available from [NeonFaucet](https://neonfaucet.org/).

The following tutorials assist you to meet these prerequisites:

- Learn how to [install a MetaMask wallet and connect it to Devnet](/docs/wallet/metamask_setup)
  > Or [connect an existing wallet to Devnet](/docs/developing/connect_rpc#connect-via-chainlist)
  > :::

<!-- I suspect there is no need to create new wallet as per first draft of page >> existing wallet probably fine -- test on run through -->

2.1 Obtain the private key for your wallet account.

> To obtain the private key from MetaMask, from the hamburger menu, click **Account Details** > **Show Private Key**, enter your password, and click **Confirm** for access to the private key for that account.
> <img src={mm_p_key} width="250" />

2.2 Create a .env file and add these lines:

```
RPC_URL_DEVNET=https://devnet.neonevm.org
CHAIN_ID_DEVNET=245022926
RPC_URL_MAINNET=https://neon-proxy-mainnet.solana.p2p.org
CHAIN_ID_MAINNET=245022934
PRIVATE_KEY=`YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY`
VERIFIER_URL_BLOCKSCOUT=https://neon-devnet.blockscout.com/api
```

:::important
Replace `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY` with your data.
:::

2.3 Run:

```
source .env
```

### Step 3: Compile contracts

The contracts are located in the project's `src/` directory. Before these contracts can be run, they must first be compiled.

3.1 To compile the project's contracts, run the following command:

```sh
forge build
```

After running this step, you should see output similar to the following:

```
[⠢] Compiling...
[⠒] Compiling 24 files with 0.8.21
[⠃] Solc 0.8.21 finished in 2.48s
Compiler run successful!
```

3.2 (Optional) test the smart contracts with:

```sh
forge test
```

### Step 4: Deploy Contracts

4.1 To deploy the project's contracts using scripts, run:

```sh
forge script script/TestERC20/DeployTestERC20.s.sol:DeployTestERC20Script --broadcast --rpc-url $RPC_URL_DEVNET --legacy --skip-simulation
```

On running this step, you should get console output similar to:

```sh
[⠢] Compiling...
[⠒] Compiling 2 files with 0.8.21
[⠢] Solc 0.8.21 finished in 842.35ms
Compiler run successful!
Script ran successfully.

SKIPPING ON CHAIN SIMULATION.

To run the script for minting tokens, define the contract address displayed in the terminal after deploying the contract in script/TestERC20/MintTestERC20.s.sol and run:

```sh
forge script script/TestERC20/MintTestERC20.s.sol:MintTestERC20Script --broadcast --rpc-url $RPC_URL_DEVNET --legacy --skip-simulation
```

On running this step, you should get console output similar to:

```sh

:::important
`--skip-simulation` parameter skips the on-chain simulation which doesn't work on Neon EVM.

The native token displayed above should be NEON instead of ETH and the unit should be Galan instead of gwei (It is not possible to customize the display).
:::

4.2 To deploy the project's contracts without scripts, run:

```sh
forge create --rpc-url $RPC_URL_DEVNET --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY src/TestERC20/TestERC20.sol:TestERC20 --constructor-args "Test ERC20 Token" "TERC20" --legacy
```

On running this step, you should get console output similar to:

```

To mint tokens to the deployer address, run:

```sh
cast send <contract_address> --rpc-url $RPC_URL_DEVNET --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY "mint(address,uint256)" <deployer_address> 20000000000000000000 --legacy
```

On running this step, you should get console output similar to:

:::important
Replace `<contract_address>` and `<deployer_address>` with your smart contract address and deployer address respectively.
:::

### Step 5: Call contract functions without publishing a transaction

To perform a call on a deployed contract without publishing a transaction, you can use `cast call` command. For example, to fetch the total supply of the deployed TestERC20 token in the previous step, you can use:

```sh
$ cast call --rpc-url $RPC_URL_DEVNET 0x5537599aa2F97Dd60a66342522a465A7f2e40Ff9 "totalSupply()" --trace
```

On running this step, you should get console output similar to:

```
Traces:
  [2326] 0x5537599aa2F97Dd60a66342522a465A7f2e40Ff9::totalSupply()
    └─ ← [Return] 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001158e460913d00000

Transaction successfully executed.
Gas used: 23390
```

:::important
`--trace` flag is mandatory for the `cast call` command to get the result of the function call.
:::

### Step 6: Contract verification

6.1 Verify the deployment of your smart contract on the explorer [Neon Blockscout](https://neon-devnet.blockscout.com) using following command:

```sh
forge verify-contract --chain-id $CHAIN_ID_DEVNET <contract_address> src/TestERC20/TestERC20.sol:TestERC20 --verifier-url $VERIFIER_URL_BLOCKSCOUT --verifier blockscout
```

:::important
Replace `<contract_address>` with your smart contract address.
:::

After successfully running this step you should get console output similar to:

```
Start verifying contract `0x5537599aa2F97Dd60a66342522a465A7f2e40Ff9` deployed on 245022926
Submitting verification for [src/TestERC20/TestERC20.sol:TestERC20] "0x5537599aa2F97Dd60a66342522a465A7f2e40Ff9".
Submitted contract for verification:
	Response: `OK`
	GUID: `5537599aa2f97dd60a66342522a465a7f2e40ff9654118b3`
	URL:
        https://neon-devnet.blockscout.com/api?/address/0x5537599aa2f97dd60a66342522a465a7f2e40ff9
```

6.2 Copy/paste this link in your browser, remembering to replace `contract_address` with your freshly deployed contract address:

```sh
https://neon-devnet.blockscout.com/address/<contract_address>
```
