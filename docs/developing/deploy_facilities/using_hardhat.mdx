*This page outlines the steps for deploying and testing contracts in the Neon EVM using the Hardhat tool.*

Before beginning the tutorial below, make sure that you have properly [configured Hardhat](configure_hardhat) for the Neon EVM.

## How to Use Hardhat: A Tutorial
The example this tutorial is based on is located in [this repository](https://github.com/neonlabsorg/neon-tutorials/tree/main/hardhat).

By the end of this tutorial, you will deploy a contract describing an ERC-20 token to Neon Devnet.

### Step 1: Installation
> **Note:** This page is just a quickstart based on a specific example program. For more details on installing Hardhat, refer to the *[Hardhat documentation](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started#overview)*.

Using Git, clone the example Hardhat project from the remote repository and navigate to it:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/neonlabsorg/neon-tutorials
cd neon-tutorials/hardhat
```

Then, run the following command:
```sh
npm install
```
This will install all the necessary packages to continue with the example. These packages include the `Hardhat` library.

If the above command results in an error, run:
```sh
npm cache clear --force
npm install
```

### Step 2: Set Up MetaMask Accounts
:::info
This step requires an EVM-compatible wallet such as MetaMask, connected to Neon Devnet, with a balance in Devnet NEON available from [NeonFaucet](https://neonfaucet.org/).

The following tutorials assist you to meet these prerequisites:
- Learn how to [install a MetaMask wallet and connect it to Devnet](/docs/wallet/metamask_setup)
> Or [connect an existing wallet to Devnet](/docs/developing/connect_rpc#connect-via-chainlist)
:::

2.1 Obtain the private key for your wallet account.

> To obtain the private key from MetaMask, from the hamburger menu, click **Account Details** > **Show Private Key**, enter your password, and click **Confirm** for access to the private key for that account.

2.2 Create a .env file and add these lines:

```
PRIVATE_KEY_OWNER=`YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY`
```
:::important
Replace `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY` with your data.
:::

2.3 Run:
```
source .env
```

### Step 3: Compile Contracts
All of the contracts are located in the project's `contracts/` directory. Before these contracts can be run, they must first be compiled. To compile the project's contracts, run the following command:
```sh
npx hardhat compile
```

After running this step, you should see output similar to the following:
```
Compiled 23 Solidity files successfully
```

### Step 4: Deploy Contracts
To deploy the project's contracts, simply run the command below to run the deployment script in the `scripts/` directory:
```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/TestERC20/deploy.js --network neondevnet
```

After running this command and deploying our TestERC20 smart contract now we can take the newly deployed contract address and included it inside `scripts/TestERC20/transfer.js` where we can intitiate a token transfer:
```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/TestERC20/transfer.js --network neondevnet
```
The output should look like:
```
Sender balance before transfer 1000000000000000000000n
Receiver balance before transfer 0n
Sender balance after transfer 990000000000000000000n
Receiver balance after transfer 10000000000000000000n
```

### Step 5: Contract verification
```
npx hardhat verify --network neondevnet `CONTRACT_ADDRESS`
```

This command is how we verify contracts on [Neonscan](https://devnet.neonscan.org). More info about verifying smart contracts thru Hardhat can be found [here](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/guides/verifying).
:::important
Replace `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` with your smart contract address.
