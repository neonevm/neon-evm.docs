*This page outlines the steps for deploying and testing contracts in the Neon EVM using the Hardhat tool.*

Before beginning the tutorial below, make sure that you have properly [configured Hardhat](configure_hardhat) for the Neon EVM.

## How to Use Hardhat: A Tutorial
The example this tutorial is based on is located in [this repository](https://github.com/neonlabsorg/neon-tutorials/tree/main/hardhat).

By the end of this tutorial, you will deploy a contract describing an ERC-20 token to the Neon Devnet.

### Step 1: Installation
> **Note:** This page is just a quickstart based on a specific example program. For more details on installing Hardhat, refer to the *[Hardhat documentation](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started#overview)*.

Using Git, clone the example Hardhat project from the remote repository and navigate to it:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/neonlabsorg/neon-tutorials
cd neon-tutorials/hardhat
```

Then, run the following command:
```sh
npm install
```
This will install all the necessary packages to continue with the example. These packages include the `Hardhat` library.

If the above command results in an error, run:
```sh
npm cache clear --force
npm install
```

### Step 2: Set Up MetaMask Accounts
:::info
This step requires an EVM-compatible wallet such as MetaMask, connected to Neon Devnet, with a balance in Devnet NEON available from [NeonFaucet](https://neonfaucet.org/).

The following tutorials assist you to meet these prerequisites:
- Learn how to [install a MetaMask wallet and connect it to Devnet](/docs/wallet/metamask_setup)
> Or [connect an existing wallet to Devnet](/docs/developing/connect_rpc#connect-via-chainlist)
:::

2.1 Obtain the private key for your wallet account.

> To obtain the private key from MetaMask, from the hamburger menu, click **Account Details** > **Show Private Key**, enter your password, and click **Confirm** for access to the private key for that account.

2.2 Create a .env file and add these lines:

```
PRIVATE_KEY_OWNER=<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>
```
:::important
Replace <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY> with your data.
:::

2.3 Run:
```
source .env
```

### Step 3: Compile Contracts
All of the contracts are located in the project's `contracts/` directory. Before these contracts can be run, they must first be compiled. To compile the project's contracts, run the following command:
```sh
npx hardhat compile
```

After running this step, you should see output similar to the following:
```
Compiled 23 Solidity files successfully
```

### Step 4: Deploy Contracts
To deploy the project's contracts, simply run the command below to run the deployment script in the `scripts/` directory:
```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/TestERC20/deploy.js --network neondevnet
```

After running this command and deploying our TestERC20 smart contract now we can take the newly deployed contract address and included it inside `scripts/TestERC20/transfer.js` where we can intitiate a token transfer:
```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/TestERC20/transfer.js --network neondevnet
```
The outpout should look like:
```
Sender balance before transfer 1000000000000000000000n
Receiver balance before transfer 0n
Sender balance after transfer 990000000000000000000n
Receiver balance after transfer 10000000000000000000n
```

### Step 5: Connect Project to MetaMask
To import your project as an asset in MetaMask, follow the instructions [here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031-How-to-add-unlisted-tokens-custom-tokens-in-MetaMask#h_01FWH492CHY60HWPC28RW0872H) and use the contract address from the previous step as the 'Token Contract Address' in MetaMask.

Once you complete this final step, you will be able to see your new ERC-20 assets in the MetaMask profiles of the new test accounts.
