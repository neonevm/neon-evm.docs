When performing operations on tokens in the Neon EVM, it is important to know which token symbol or address can be used. Having a list of possible tokens available, you can easily navigate when choosing the token you need.

*The list of tokens whose contracts are deployed in Neon EVM and which are available to you can be found in the [token-list](https://github.com/neonlabsorg/token-list/) repository*.
