# Neon EVM 1.18 Mainnet Release
Release Date:   January 7, 2025

## 1. Overview

This release focuses on bridging the gap between Ethereum and Solana by introducing native Solana wallet support, implementing the EIP-1559 fee mechanism, refining time-sensitive operations, and optimizing Solidity contract storage. Collectively, these improvements enhance user experience, streamline dApp development, and maintain Ethereum parity.

## 2. Key Features

### 2.1 Solana-Native Wallet Support & Signature SDK

**Summary**
Neon EVM now supports direct interaction with Solana-native wallets (Phantom, Backpack, Solflare). This removes the need for EVM-centric wallets like MetaMask, creating a frictionless experience for Solana users.

**Details**

- Introduces a dedicated Signature SDK for seamless Solana wallet integration.
- Eliminates wallet switching or added complexity for users accustomed to Solana ecosystems.

**Impact**

- **Frictionless UX**: Users can continue using their favorite Solana wallets without extra steps.
- **Broader User Reach**: Simplifies onboarding for both Solana and Ethereum communities.

### 2.2 EIP-1559 Fee Mechanism

**Summary**

Neon EVM now implements the Ethereum EIP-1559 fee model, using two parameters to manage transaction costs and prioritization.

**Details**

- **baseFeePerGas**: Predictable base fee covering Solana fees and the operator margin.
- **priorityFeePerGas**: Optional premium users can add to speed up transactions.
- Full alignment with popular Ethereum tooling (e.g., MetaMask, Web3.js).

**Impact**

- **Fee predictability**: Enhanced accuracy for user fee estimations.
- **Simplicity**: Leverages familiar Ethereum ecosystems and developer tools.
- **Fairness**: Separates mandatory fees from acceleration fees.

### 2.3 Enhanced `block.timestamp`

**Summary**

Addresses previous disparities between Ethereum and Solana infrastructures by ensuring `block.timestamp` and `block.number` behave as they do on Ethereum.

**Details**

- Removes inconsistencies in time-based operations.
- No workaround logic needed for applications that rely on precise time or block metrics.

**Impact**

- **Accurate time-based mechanics**: Critical for interest accrual, staking, and games.
- **Streamlined dApp development**: Ethereum developers can maintain existing time-sensitive code.

### 2.4 Saving HEAP in Solana Accounts

**Summary**

Solidity contracts now persist HEAP states across transactions by saving these in Solana accounts.

**Details**

- Memory-intensive Solidity dApps can store data more efficiently.
- Reduces in-transaction memory overhead by leveraging Solana’s accounts system.

**Impact**

- **Optimized resource usage**: Ideal for complex dApps requiring significant memory.
- **Improved contract stability**: Lowers the risk of hitting memory limits in high-throughput scenarios.

## 3. Why it matters

Neon EVM 1.18 creates a more cohesive development experience, merging the strengths of Ethereum and Solana:

- **Seamless wallet integration**: Solana users don’t need new wallets or conversion tools.
- **Optimized fees**: The EIP-1559 model offers clarity, predictability, and fairness.
- **Accurate timing**: Key for finance, staking, and real-time applications.
- **Enhanced storage**: More robust support for complex or large-scale contracts.

## 4. Upgrade notes

1. **Review wallet integrations**
    - If your dApp is designed for MetaMask or similar wallets, test the new Solana wallet flow.
2. **Adjust fee settings**
    - Update fee-logic to use both `baseFeePerGas` and `priorityFeePerGas` for accurate estimates.
3. **Time-based contracts**
    - Validate any contracts that rely on `block.timestamp` or `block.number` to ensure desired behavior.
4. **Check storage configurations**
    - If your contract handles large data sets, confirm that HEAP storage in Solana accounts is working as expected.

## 5. Fixes

- Gas limit estimation: Resolved an issue where the gas estimation mechanism inaccurately predicted significantly higher gas usage. The estimation logic has been optimized to provide more accurate projections.
- Slow emulation during iterations: Addressed a performance bottleneck in the emulation process that previously caused delays during iterative Solana transactions. The updated emulation logic now executes significantly faster, ensuring smoother transaction processing.
- Hanging transactions in optimistic execution: Fixed a bug in the optimistic execution mechanism that led to certain transactions hanging or failing to complete. Transactions now execute reliably without interruptions.
- Priority fee distribution: Improved the distribution of the user’s priority fee, ensuring a more equitable allocation between Solana Validators and operators. While the previous implementation disproportionately allocated fees to operators, the updated mechanism distributes compute prices more effectively, aligning with the intended behavior.
