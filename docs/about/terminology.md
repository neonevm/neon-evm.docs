### Application Binary Interface (ABI)
A JSON-based description on how to convert user actions between their JSON and binary representations. The ABI may also describe how to convert the database state to/from JSON. Once you have described your contract via an ABI, this allows developers and users to interact with your contract seamlessly via JSON.  

---  

### Account
A unique identifier that is required to interact with Solana. Unlike most other cryptocurrencies, transfers are sent to a readable account name instead of a public key, while keys attributed to the account are used to sign transactions.  

---  

### Block
A special structure for recording a group of transactions in blockchain systems. A block consists of a header and a list of transactions. The block header includes its hash, the hash of the previous block, transaction hashes, and additional overhead information.  

---  

### Blockchain
A database with a strict structure and certain rules for building chains of transactions and accessing information which excludes data theft, fraud, violation of property rights, and more.  

---  

### Block log
An append-only log of blocks written to disk and containing all the irreversible blocks.  

---  

### Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF)

---  

### Cryptographic Hash Function (CHF)
A type of hash function that takes an input (or `message`) and returns a fixed-size alphanumeric string. The alphanumeric string is called the `hash value`, `message digest`, `digital fingerprint`, `digest`, or `checksum`.  

---  

### Daemon
A program on Linux systems that is launched by the system itself and runs in the background without direct user interaction.  

---  

### Decentralized Application (dApp)
An application built on a decentralized network that combines a smart contract and a frontend user interface.  

---  

### Digital signature
A mathematical algorithm used to verify the authenticity and integrity of digital messages or documents. A valid digital signature helps to reassure the recipient that the message was created by a known sender, and that the message was not altered in transit. Digital signatures are a standard feature of most cryptographic protocol suites, and are also commonly used for software distribution, financial transactions, contract management software, and other cases where it is important to detect and/or prevent forgery or tampering.  

---  

### Docker
Software used to automate application installation in the virtualization environment at the operating system level. Packages an application, along with all its environments and dependencies, into a container that can be ported to any Linux system with cgroups support in the kernel, and also provides a container management environment.  

---  

### Docker Compose
A command line tool for managing multiple Docker multi-container applications.  

---  

### Dockerfile

---  

### Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)
A consensus algorithm initially developed by Daniel Larimer in 2013 for BitShares. It is sometimes referred to as the more “democratic” version of Proof-of-Stake (PoS).  

---  

### ERC-20
The token standard used for Ethereum smart contracts. Developed in 2015, ERC-20 defines a common list of rules that Ethereum tokens must implement. This gives developers the ability to program how new tokens will function within the Ethereum ecosystem.  

---  

### ERC-721
A more complex token standard than ERC-20 that is split across a number of contracts with multiple optional extensions. Unlike ERC-20, tokens of this standard are not interchangeable. No two ERC-721 tokens are the same, and each have different characteristics.  

---  

### Gwei
A denomination, or smaller unit, of the cryptocurrency ETH, which is used on the Ethereum network. Gwei is the most commonly used unit of ETH because gas prices are easily specified in gwei. For example, instead of saying that your gas costs *0.000000001* ETH, you can say your gas costs *1* gwei.  

---  

### Head block
The head block is the last block written to the blockchain, stored in reversible blocks.  

---  

### Key
A string of characters (bit string) that is used by the cryptographic algorithm for encrypting and decrypting messages, setting and verifying digital signatures, and identification. Keys are symmetric (the same key is used for encryption and decryption), and asymmetric (public and private).  

---  

### Merkle Mountain Range
A type of merkle tree that can be visualized as many (perfect) merkle trees which are then combined into 1, by creating a single root from all of their peaks.  

---  

### Merkle-Patricia Tree
A hash tree that stores key-value pairs, with the keys being represented in binary form. The nodes of this tree consist of two types: prefix nodes that contain part of the path, and end nodes that contain the stored value.  

---  

### MetaMask
A software cryptocurrency wallet that is used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to access their Ethereum wallet through a browser extension or mobile app, which can then be used to interact with decentralized applications.  

---  

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
