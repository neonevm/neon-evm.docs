**Neon EVM** is _the_ solution that makes Solana's throughput, swift block speeds, and low gas prices available to Ethereum contracts. Neon EVM interacts directly with Solana nodes to carry out transactions on Solana. The service is made up of three main components:

- Neon EVM
- Neon Proxy
- Neon DAO

This page presents a high-level overview of each, and the native tools and integrations available within the Neon Ecosystem.

## Neon EVM program

The **Neon EVM program** is a smart contract on the Solana blockchain. The Neon EVM program accepts Ethereum-like transactions and processes them on Solana according to Ethereum rules. Ethereum transactions directed to the Neon EVM are called Neon Transactions.

> **Neon Transactions**: a [subset of Ethereum's JSON-RPC Specification](/docs/evm_compatibility/json_rpc_api_methods) may be directed to the Neon EVM to be used as inputs for the targeted Neon clients.

## Neon Proxy

It's the Neon Proxy that allows Ethereum dApps to be ported to Neon with minimal reconfiguration. Neon Proxy packages a EVM transaction into a Solana transaction. The Proxy is provided as a containerized solution that's intuitive for [Operators](/docs/operating/operator-introduction).

:::info
**Neon Operators** run Neon Proxy servers to facilitate the seamless execution of Ethereum-like transactions on Solana. It is this proxy service that allows Ethereum dApps to be ported to Neon with minimal reconfiguration. Operators accept payment in NEON (although the roadmap will expand the options) and make payments within the Solana Ecosystem in SOL.

### The NEON token

The NEON token is a utility token with 2 functions:

#### 1. Payment of gas fees

The Neon Proxy Operator accepts payment from the user in [NEON tokens](/docs/tokens/neon_token) to pay the [gas fees](/docs/tokens/gas_fees) required for transaction execution.

#### 2. Governance

Owners of the Neon token may engage in the Neon DAO activities.

## Neon DAO

The DAO provides custodial services to Neon Foundation, assisting the foundation to direct future research and development. The Neon DAO exists as a series of contracts deployed on Solana to provide a governance layer to control the functionality of Neon EVM. DAO participants utilize a web interface to allow the community, i.e. NEON holders, to raise and vote on proposals that impact the functioning of the Neon EVM.

## Neon Tools

### Block explorer

[NeonScan](https://neonscan.org/) provides a block explorer and analytics platform to examine Neon transactions within Solana.

### NeonPass

[NeonPass](https://devnet.neonpass.live/) transfers ERC-20 tokens between Solana and Neon EVM. The [ERC-20 SPL wrapper](/docs/developing/deploy_facilities/interacting_with_spl_tokens) makes such transfers possible via (non-custodial) wallets.

> See the [NeonPass guide](/docs/token_transferring/neonpass_usage).

### NeonFaucet

[NeonFaucet](https://neonfaucet.org/) provides NEON test tokens and other ERC-20 test tokens to be used for testing applications on DevNet.

## Integrations

Neon EVM integrates with several essential services:

### Oracles

Oracles enable the decentralized Web3 ecosystem to access price feeds and other external (off-chain) data sources. Neon EVM supports querying data from Solana deployed Oracles:

- [Chainlink](/docs/developing/integrate/oracles/integrating_chainlink)
- [Pyth](/docs/developing/integrate/oracles/integrating_pyth)

### Wallets

Neon EVM is supported by EVM-compatible wallets such as MetaMask's non-custodial wallet.

> This allows dApp devs to sign deployment transactions and mint tokens.

<!-- > Learn more about minting and wrapping tokens with Neon EVM. suggest adding link here as Phantom wallet is involved for Solana-based mints -->

### Protocols

Neon EVM integrates with the popular WalletConnect protocol that provides a decentralized standard to connect Web3 wallets and dApps.

### Tracer API

Neon's Tracer API is an extension for Neon Proxy. It assists developers to test, debug, and understand the behavior of their smart contracts on Neon EVM. The API provides a full externality trace on any Neon transactions executed on the Solana blockchain.

The Tracer API supports a rerun of historical transactions, runs transactions on historical states, and analyzes the state of the Solana blockchain after the execution of each instruction.
