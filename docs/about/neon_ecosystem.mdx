**Neon EVM** is a solution that leverages Solana's high throughput, fast block speeds, and low gas fees for Ethereum-compatible smart contracts. Neon EVM interacts directly with Solana nodes to execute transactions. The ecosystem comprises three core components:

- Neon EVM
- Neon Proxy
- Neon DAO

This page provides a high-level overview of these components, along with native tools and integrations within the Neon Ecosystem.

## Neon EVM Program

The **Neon EVM program** is a smart contract deployed on the Solana blockchain. It processes Ethereum-like transactions, referred to as **Neon Transactions**, on Solana while adhering to Ethereum's rules.

> **Neon Transactions**: A [subset of Ethereum's JSON-RPC Specification](/docs/evm_compatibility/json_rpc_api_methods) can be directed to the Neon EVM as inputs for targeted Neon clients.

## Neon Proxy

The **Neon Proxy** enables Ethereum dApps to be ported to Neon EVM with minimal reconfiguration by packaging EVM transactions into Solana transactions. It is provided as a containerized solution for [Operators](/docs/operating/operator-introduction).

:::info
**Neon Operators** run Neon Proxy servers to facilitate Ethereum-like transactions on Solana. Operators accept payments in NEON tokens (with plans to expand payment options) and settle payments within the Solana ecosystem in SOL.

### The NEON Token

The **NEON token** serves two primary functions:

#### 1. Payment of Gas Fees

Neon Proxy Operators accept [NEON tokens](/docs/tokens/neon_token) from users to cover [gas fees](/docs/tokens/gas_fees) for transaction execution.

#### 2. Governance

NEON token holders can participate in Neon DAO activities to influence the ecosystem's development.

## Neon DAO

The **Neon DAO** provides custodial services to the Neon Foundation, guiding future research and development. Deployed as a series of smart contracts on Solana, the DAO enables NEON token holders to propose and vote on initiatives that impact Neon EVM functionality through a web interface.

## Neon Tools

### Block Explorer

[BlockScout](https://neon.blockscout.com/) offers a block explorer and analytics platform to inspect Neon transactions on Solana.

### NeonPass

[NeonPass](https://devnet.neonpass.live/) facilitates the transfer of ERC-20 tokens between Solana and Neon EVM using an [ERC-20 SPL wrapper](/docs/developing/deploy_facilities/interacting_with_spl_tokens) via non-custodial wallets.

> See the [NeonPass guide](/docs/token_transferring/neonpass_usage) for details.

### NeonFaucet

[NeonFaucet](https://neonfaucet.org/) provides NEON test tokens and other ERC-20 test tokens for testing applications on DevNet.

## Integrations

Neon EVM integrates with several essential services:

### Oracles

Oracles provide access to off-chain data, such as price feeds, for the Web3 ecosystem. Neon EVM supports Solana-deployed oracles:

- [Chainlink](/docs/developing/integrate/oracles/integrating_chainlink)
- [Pyth](/docs/developing/integrate/oracles/integrating_pyth)

### Wallets

Neon EVM supports EVM-compatible wallets, including MetaMask and others. For a full list of supported wallets, see our [FAQ](/docs/faq/wallets).

> These wallets enable developers to sign deployment transactions and mint tokens. Learn more about [minting and wrapping tokens](/docs/developing/deploy_facilities/minting_tokens).

### Protocols

Neon EVM integrates with the **WalletConnect** protocol, providing a decentralized standard for connecting Web3 wallets and dApps.

### Tracer API

The **Tracer API** extends Neon Proxy to help developers test, debug, and analyze smart contracts on Neon EVM. It provides detailed transaction traces, supports rerunning historical transactions, and analyzes Solana blockchain states post-execution.

> Learn more in the [Tracer API documentation](/docs/developing/tracer_api).

## Development Tools

Neon EVM supports popular development tools, including:

- [Hardhat](/docs/developing/deploy_facilities/using_hardhat)
- [Remix](/docs/developing/deploy_facilities/using_remix)
- [Foundry](/docs/developing/deploy_facilities/using_foundry)
