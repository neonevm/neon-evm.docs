## Introduction

This guide explains how participants subject to a vesting schedule can access the Neon EVM Governance service and use it to claim available tokens.

## How to prepare for claiming your vested tokens

* Ensure you have one of the following Solana-compatible wallets installed in your browser:
   * Phantom
   * Solflare
   * Ledger
   * Backpack
   * WalletConnect
* Verify that this Solana wallet controls the wallet address provided to the Neon EVM team during the Token Generation Event of August 2023.
* Ensure your Solana wallet contains enough SOL tokens to cover the gas fees for withdrawal transactions.

## Steps to Claim the NEON Vested Tokens

### 1. Access the Neon Governance interface & Connect Your Wallet

* Navigate to https://vote.neondao.org/.
