## Principles

To ensure that the Neon DAO works smoothly and is effective at implementing the community's vision, there are a few guiding principles that people engaging with this DAO must follow. These include:

* Respecting the rights of all Neon community members
* Acting in good faith
* Seeking to resolve disputes in a constructive and collaborative manner
* Encouraging a diversity of perspectives
* Promoting openness and transparency

There are also more concrete prohibitions on improper behavior that must be kept in mind, including that:

* Members must not threaten other members.
* No member should improperly influence the vote of another.
* Members agree to hold software developers blameless for unintentional mistakes made by them in the expression of contractual intent, whether or not said mistakes were due to actual or perceived negligence.

In addition, the NEON DAO is transparent and flexible. All users have access to all relevant information in order to make well-informed decisions, and the governance process is adaptable to the ever-evolving needs of the community.

### Rules and Etiquette

The DAO Forum is not the place for general discussions, advertising, off-topic conversations, or political discussions. The following are some basic rules that people posting on the DAO Forum are expected to follow.

1. All users have an equal say. No single user or group of users can have undue influence over the governance process.

2. Decisions are made based on consensus. All users have a say in the decision-making process, and decisions are only made when there is broad agreement among the community.

3. Transparency is key. All users must have access to all relevant information in order to make informed decisions. The governance process must be open and transparent to all.

4. Decentralized governance is flexible. The governance process should be flexible and adaptable to the ever-changing needs of the community.

5. Users are accountable for their actions. All users must be held accountable for their actions and decisions within the governance process. There must be mechanisms in place to ensure that users act in the best interests of the community.

## Measures Against Abuse and Misuse

Like any governance system, the Neon DAO faces the risk of malicious actors being involved, which could jeopardize the Neon ecosystem as well as treasury or user funds if their subversive proposals are erroneously passed. To reduce this risk, the Neon DAO has implemented defensive measures in several key areas, corresponding to stages along the process of a proposal becoming implemented. These areas include limiting the number of proposals, detecting malicious proposals, and cancelling malicious proposals.

### Limiting the Number of Proposals
Malicious actors have an easier time pushing through one of their proposals if they can submit as many proposals as they like. To prevent this, the Neon DAO's Assemblies have protections in place to limit the number of proposals an Assembly can accept from a given user. These measures include:

* SPL Governance's built-in limit of 10 active proposals per account
* A minimum amount of locked tokens necessary for a user to create a proposal (each Assembly has different requirements)
* Some Assemblies require a higher locked token threshold for creating proposals than for updating the Neon EVM

Besides preventing the proliferation of malicious proposals, these measures also reduce spam, making the governance system easier to use and more efficient.
