# How to Withdraw SPL Tokens from Neon EVM

## Goal

Transfer ERC-20 tokens from Neon EVM to the Solana blockchain to the account with the SPL token balance using Neon Pass. This is the reverse operation of [transferring SPL tokens from Solana to Neon EVM](https://docs.neon-labs.org/docs/software_manuals/how_to_guides/transfer_spl_to_neonevm).

## Before you begin

Make sure you meet the following requirements:
  * Understand the following:
    * What is the [Solana network](https://docs.solana.com/clusters).
    * What is the [Metamask](https://docs.neon-labs.org/docs/glossary#metamask).
    * What is the [Phantom](https://docs.neon-labs.org/docs/glossary#phantom).
  * Neon Pass is deployed in the browser to which your [Metamask](https://docs.neon-labs.org/docs/glossary#metamask) and [Phantom](https://docs.neon-labs.org/docs/glossary#phantom) wallets are attached.
  * Learn the guide ["How to Connect Metamask to Solana's Network"](https://docs.neon-labs.org/docs/software_manuals/how_to_guides/connect_metamask_to_solana).
