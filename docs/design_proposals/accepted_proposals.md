# Accepted Design Proposals

The following design proposals have been accepted by the Neon team. They will be investigated more thoroughly before they are implemented, and may be implemented differently or not implemented at all. If implemented, the proposal will be moved to [Implemented Proposals](https://docs.neon-labs.org/docs/design_proposals/implemented/implemented_proposals), and the details will be added to the relevant sections of the documentation.
