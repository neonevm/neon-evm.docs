# Terminology Used

### ABI
The Application Binary Interface (ABI) is a JSON-based description on how to convert user actions between their JSON and binary representations. The ABI may also describe how to convert the database state to/from JSON. Once you have described your contract via an ABI this allows developers and users to interact with your contract seamlessly via JSON.

### Account
An account is a unique identifier and a requirement to interact with Solana. Unlike most other cryptocurrencies, transfers are sent to a human readable account name instead of a public key, while keys attributed to the account are used to sign transactions.  

---  

### Block
A special structure for recording a group of transactions in the Bitcoin system and similar ones. A block consists of a header and a list of transactions. The block header includes its own hash, the hash of the previous block, transaction hashes, and additional overhead information.  

---  

### Blockchain
A strictly structured database with certain rules for building chains of transactions and access to information that excludes data theft, fraud, violation of property rights, etc.  

---  

### Block Log
The block log is an append only log of blocks written to disk and contains all the irreversible blocks.  

---  

### Community
A group of persons formed around some point of interest. Community can be created by any user or group of users. Each community has its own point and parameters.  

---  

### Container
An object created using a Docker image and containing all the necessary components for the operation of the application. The container is a secure platform for the operation of the application.  

---  

### Cryptographic Hash
A cryptographic hash function is a hash function which takes an input (or `message`) and returns a fixed-size alphanumeric string. The alphanumeric string is called the `hash value`, `message digest`, `digital fingerprint`, `digest` or `checksum`.  

---  

### Daemon
A program on Linux systems, launched by the system itself and running in the background without direct user interaction.  

---  

### Digital Signature
A digital signature is a mathematical scheme for verifying the authenticity of digital messages or documents. A valid digital signature, where the prerequisites are satisfied, gives a recipient very strong reason to believe that the message was created by a known sender (authentication), and that the message was not altered in transit (integrity). Digital signatures are a standard element of most cryptographic protocol suites, and are commonly used for software distribution, financial transactions, contract management software, and in other cases where it is important to detect forgery or tampering.  

---  

### Docker
Software to automate the installation of the application in the virtualization environment at the operating system level. Provides installation of an application with all its environments and dependencies into a container that can be ported to any Linux system with cgroups support in the kernel, and also provides a container management environment.  

---  

### Docker-compose
Command line tool for managing multiple Docker multi-container applications.  

---  

### Docker-file
A file containing instructions and parameters for creating a Docker image for specific tasks.  

---  

### Docker image
Docker platform template, available only by reading and used to create containers.  

---  

### DPoS (Delegated Proof-of-Stake)
DPoS stands for "Delegated Proof of Stake" and is a consensus algorithm initially developed by Daniel Larimer in 2013 for Bitshares. It's sometimes referred to as "Democracy as Proof of Stake".  

---  

### Head Block
The head block is the last block written to the blockchain, stored in reversible blocks.  

---  

### Key
A string of characters (bit string) used by the cryptographic algorithm for encrypting and decrypting messages, setting and verifying a digital signature, as well as identification. Keys are symmetric (the same key is used for encryption and decryption) and asymmetric (public and private).  

---  

### Merkle Mountain Range
A type of merkle tree that can be visualized as many (perfect) merkle trees which are then combined into 1, by creating a single root from all of their peaks.  

---  

### MetaMask
MetaMask is a software cryptocurrency wallet used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to access their Ethereum wallet through a browser extension or mobile app, which can then be used to interact with decentralized applications.

----  

### Node
A separate (software) device that is connected to the blockchain network according to the client-server scheme. Nodes are active elements and form the basis of the blockchain network technology.  

---  

### Plugin
A software component, made as a separate module and being an addition to the main program.  

---  

### Private key
A code string with which you can access your wallet or bitcoin address. Required for transactions.  
A private key is a secret key used to sign transactions.  

---  

### Public key
A publicly available key that can be authorized to permissions of an account and can be used to identify the origin transaction. A public key can be inferred from a signature.  

---  

### Remix
Remix is an online web tool. It is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) used to write, compile, deploy and debug Solidity code. Can be connected with Metamask and used to deploy smart contracts to both the Solana Testnet and Mainnet.

---  

### Serialization
Serialization is the process of turning an object in memory into a stream of bytes so it can be stored on disk or sent over the network.  

---  

### Signature
A signature is a mathematical scheme for demonstrating the authenticity of digital messages or documents.  

---  

### Smart Contract
A smart contract is a computer protocol intended to facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract.  

---  

### Staked tokens
Tokens allocated for a stake acquisition that can’t be used for anything else in this state. The user can stake active tokens listed on his/her balance or deposit them. Also, the user can perform the reverse operation — withdraw tokens from the staked state to active.  

---  

### Transaction
A complete all-or-nothing change to the Blockchain. A combination of one or more actions. Usually the execution result of a Smart Contract.  

---  

### MetaMask Wallet
Wallets are clients that store keys that may or may not be associated with the permissions of one or more accounts. Ideally a wallet has a locked (encrypted) and unlocked (decrypted) state that is protected by a high entropy password.
